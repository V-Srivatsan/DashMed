## Usage
**Note:** This is a prototype, and needs some basic setup for all the components to work properly.

### Admin App
The apps can be sideloaded in any android phone running Android version 7.0 or higher.
After loading the DashMed-Admin app, use the following credentials to login:
`Username: gplex
Password: login0408`

In order to prevent unauthorised changes to this account, the password cannot be changed for this particular account.


### Ordering as a User
In order for your order to be picked up by a warehouse, it needs to have employees present, stocks in the inventory and be within a 5 km radius.
For this to work, you need to enable developer options and use the __Mock Location__ feature to emulate your location for this particular app. Select __DashMed__ and you're done!
